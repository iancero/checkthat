Description: The checkthat package provides a lightweight data validation and 
    testing toolkit for R. Its guiding philosophy is that adding code-based data 
    checks to users' existing workflow should be both quick and intuitive. The 
    suite of functions included therefore mirror the common data checks many 
    users already perform by hand or by eye. Additionally, the checkthat 
    package is optimized to work within tidyverse data manipulation pipelines.
